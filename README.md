## Official Implementations of `Bayesian Penalized Empirical Likelihood and MCMC Sampling`

## Introduction

We introduce a novel methodological framework referred to as Bayesian penalized empirical likelihood, designed to tackle the computational challenges associated with empirical likelihood methods. Our approach pursues two primary objectives: firstly, preserving the inherent flexibility of empirical likelihood to accommodate a wide range of model conditions, and secondly, providing convenient access to well-established Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling schemes as alternatives to the intricate optimization steps in empirical likelihood. Our Bayesian penalized empirical likelihood framework offers a highly flexible and efficient approach, enhancing the adaptability and practicality of empirical likelihood methods in statistical inference. Importantly, our study demonstrates the practical advantages of employing sampling techniques over traditional optimization methods in solving empirical likelihood problems. These techniques exhibit rapid convergence to global optima of posterior distributions, ensuring effective resolution of complex statistical estimation problem.
